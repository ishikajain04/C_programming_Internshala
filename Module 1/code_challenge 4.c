/*Write a program to find out the grade of a student based on the marks secured in the exam.
  Consider the following while writing the program:

  Maximum marks that can be secured by a student is 500
  If marks secured by the student is :
   :Greater than or equal to 450 and less than or equal to 500: ‘A’ grade
   :Greater than or equal to 400 and below 450: ‘B’ grade
   :Greater than or equal to 350 and below 400: ‘C’ grade
   :Greater than or equal to 250 and below 350: ‘D’ grade
   :Greater than or equal to 150 and below 250: ‘E’ grade
   :Less than 150: ‘F’ grade  
   Allow user to input his total marks secured out of 500
  Consider how your program should behave if 
  the user enters a negative number or enters marks above 500
  Use else-if ladder statements
